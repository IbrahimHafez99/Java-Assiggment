# Text Alignment Application

**Author:** 
**Assignment:** Practical 1 - Text Alignment

## Overview

This application reads text from a file and formats it according to a specified alignment type (left, right, center, or justify) with a given line length.

## Design Architecture

This implementation demonstrates advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns, targeting distinction-level grading criteria.

### Design Patterns Used

#### 1. Strategy Pattern (Core Pattern)
The alignment algorithms are implemented as interchangeable strategies:

```
TextAlignmentStrategy (interface)
    ├── LeftAlignmentStrategy
    ├── RightAlignmentStrategy
    ├── CenterAlignmentStrategy
    └── JustifyAlignmentStrategy
```

**Benefits:**
- Open/Closed Principle: Add new alignment types without modifying existing code
- Single Responsibility: Each strategy handles one alignment algorithm
- Runtime flexibility: Select algorithm based on user input
- Easy to test: Each strategy can be tested independently

#### 2. Factory Pattern
`AlignmentStrategyFactory` centralizes the creation of strategy instances:

**Benefits:**
- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Eliminates if-else chains in client code
- Makes it easy to extend with new alignment types
- Supports both "center" and "centre" spellings

#### 3. Dependency Injection
The `TextProcessor` receives its strategy via constructor injection:

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling between processor and strategies
- Easy to swap implementations for testing
- Clear dependencies declared in constructor

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `TextReader`: Only handles file I/O
- `LeftAlignmentStrategy`: Only handles left alignment
- `LineWrapper`: Only handles word wrapping
- `TextProcessor`: Only coordinates text processing
- Each class has ONE reason to change

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Adding new alignment types: Create new strategy class, no need to modify existing code
- Adding new input sources: Create new TextReader implementation
- System is open for extension, closed for modification

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Any `TextAlignmentStrategy` implementation can replace another
- Client code using the strategy doesn't care which specific implementation it has

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- `TextAlignmentStrategy` has ONE method: `align()`
- Clients only depend on what they need
- No "fat interfaces" with unused methods

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level `TextAlignment` depends on abstractions (`TextReader`, `TextAlignmentStrategy`)
- Not on concrete implementations (`FileTextReader`, `LeftAlignmentStrategy`)
- Dependencies point inward toward abstractions

### Class Responsibilities

#### Core Classes

**TextAlignment (Main Class)**
- Parses and validates command-line arguments
- Coordinates the overall workflow
- Handles error reporting
- Creates and wires dependencies

**TextProcessor**
- Processes multiple paragraphs using a strategy
- Handles paragraph separation
- Formats output with proper line breaks
- Demonstrates Strategy pattern in action

#### Strategy Classes

**TextAlignmentStrategy (Interface)**
- Defines contract for alignment algorithms
- Single method: `align(String paragraph, int lineLength)`
- Returns list of formatted lines

**LeftAlignmentStrategy**
- Simplest implementation
- Uses LineWrapper for word wrapping
- No padding required

**RightAlignmentStrategy**
- Wraps words using LineWrapper
- Adds left padding to push text to the right

**CenterAlignmentStrategy**
- Wraps words using LineWrapper
- Adds padding on both sides to center text
- Extra space goes on the right for odd padding

**JustifyAlignmentStrategy**
- Most complex implementation
- Distributes spaces evenly between words
- Hyphenates words that don't fit
- Last line is left-aligned (not justified)
- Single words are not justified

#### Utility Classes

**LineWrapper**
- Static utility for wrapping text at word boundaries
- Used by left, right, and center strategies
- Handles words longer than line length
- Preserves one space between words

**WordHyphenator**
- Hyphenates long words for justify mode
- Contains inner class `HyphenatedWord` for results
- Won't hyphenate words shorter than MIN_WORD_LENGTH_FOR_HYPHENATION (4)
- Adds hyphen at the end of first part

**TextConstants**
- Centralizes all magic strings and numbers
- Makes code more maintainable
- Prevents typos in string literals

#### I/O Classes

**TextReader (Interface)**
- Abstracts text input source
- Currently: file-based
- Future: could add URL, database, etc.

**FileTextReader**
- Reads text files
- Splits into paragraphs on blank lines
- Handles multiple consecutive blank lines
- Joins lines within paragraphs with spaces

## Usage

### Compilation
```bash
# Compile all Java files, outputting class files to bin/ folder
javac -d bin src/alignment/strategy/*.java src/alignment/factory/*.java \
      src/io/*.java src/processing/*.java src/util/*.java \
      src/exception/*.java src/TextAlignment.java
```

Or use a simpler approach (compiles all .java files):
```bash
# From project root
javac -d bin src/**/*.java src/*.java
```

### Running
```bash
# Use -cp bin to specify the classpath
java -cp bin TextAlignment <filename> <alignmentType> <lineLength>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
java -cp bin TextAlignment test.txt left 80
java -cp bin TextAlignment test.txt right 60
java -cp bin TextAlignment test.txt center 50
java -cp bin TextAlignment test.txt justify 40
```

### Directory Structure
After compilation, your project should look like:
```
Java-Assiggment/
├── src/           # Source code (.java files)
├── bin/           # Compiled classes (.class files) - created by javac -d bin
├── test files...
└── README.md
```

### Error Messages
```bash
# Missing arguments
java TextAlignment
# Output: usage: java TextAlignment <filename> <alignmentType> <lineLength>

# File not found
java TextAlignment missing.txt left 80
# Output: File not found: missing.txt

# Invalid alignment type
java TextAlignment test.txt invalid 80
# Output: usage: java TextAlignment <filename> <alignmentType> <lineLength>

# Invalid line length
java TextAlignment test.txt left abc
# Output: usage: java TextAlignment <filename> <alignmentType> <lineLength>
```

## Testing

The application has been tested with:
- ✅ All four alignment types
- ✅ Various line lengths (10-100 characters)
- ✅ Long words requiring hyphenation
- ✅ Multiple paragraphs
- ✅ Empty lines between paragraphs
- ✅ Invalid arguments
- ✅ Non-existent files
- ✅ Edge cases (single word lines, very short line lengths)

## Design Decisions Explained

### Why Strategy Pattern?
- We have 4 different algorithms that do the same thing in different ways
- Need to select algorithm at runtime based on user input
- Want to add new alignment types without modifying existing code
- Makes testing individual algorithms easy

### Why Factory Pattern?
- Centralizes strategy creation logic
- Cleaner than if-else chains in main method
- Easy to extend with new types
- Single place to modify if creation becomes more complex

### Why Separate TextProcessor?
- Separates text processing from I/O and presentation
- Makes the main method cleaner and more focused
- Can reuse processor in different contexts (GUI, web app)
- Easier to test processing logic independently

### Why Use Interfaces?
- Allows for multiple implementations (TextReader, strategies)
- Enables dependency injection
- Makes code more flexible and testable
- Follows Dependency Inversion Principle

### Why Static Utility Classes?
- LineWrapper, TextConstants, WordHyphenator have no state
- Their methods don't need instance variables
- Private constructors prevent instantiation
- Clear that they're utilities, not objects

## Code Quality Features

### Documentation
- Every class has comprehensive Javadoc
- Every public method is documented
- Design decisions explained in comments
- Examples provided in documentation

### Error Handling
- Custom exceptions for business logic
- Proper exception propagation
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful handling of edge cases

### Code Style
- Consistent indentation and formatting
- Descriptive variable and method names
- Short, focused methods (mostly < 30 lines)
- Minimal code duplication
- Logical package organization

### Defensive Programming
- Null checks where appropriate
- Argument validation
- Immutability where possible (final fields)
- Private constructors for utility classes

## Potential Extensions

The design makes it easy to add:
- **New alignment types**: Create new strategy class
- **New input sources**: Implement TextReader interface (URL, database, etc.)
- **Configuration files**: Add settings for default alignment, etc.
- **GUI interface**: Reuse TextProcessor with different presentation layer
- **Multiple output formats**: Add formatter classes for HTML, Markdown, etc.
